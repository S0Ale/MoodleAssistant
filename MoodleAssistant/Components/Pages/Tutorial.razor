        <h2 class="text-center text-3xl text-gray-700">Let's take an example of how MQ-Replicator works.</h2>
        <p class="mt-3">
            Think about teachers asking their students what is the capital of some states.
            How boring can be creating a question for each state?
            MQ-Replicator can be the solution!
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-20">
        <h2 class="text-center text-3xl text-gray-700">1. First of all you need a Moodle question in Moodle XML Format.</h2>
        <p class="mt-3">
            When you create a question, where possible, you must put into question and answers textarea "placeholders".<br />
            Placeholders format is <span class="code">[*[[what-you-want]]*]</span> and are used from MQ-Replicator to find which word you want to replace.
            Now you must export the question in Moodle XML Format.
            (<a class="text-blue-500" href="https://docs.moodle.org/310/en/Export_questions" target="_blank">How to export questions in Moodle?</a>) Make sure do not check "write category to file".
            If it is not possible to edit directly in Moodle you must find your identifiers and add <span class="code">[*[[</span> and <span class="code">]]*]</span> in file previously exported.<br />
            In our example we had:
